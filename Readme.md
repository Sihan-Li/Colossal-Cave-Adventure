Feature added:
	1. Success status of the game:
		You should take the treasure to the castle, there lives the princess, and then you are win.
	2. Death of player:
		The treasure is in the treasureRoom, where there exists a dragon, you must go into the room with weapons, or you'll be killed by the dragon, so take a weapon, go to the treasureRoom and take the treasure, give it to princess, and you will win!

The map is modified according to the success/fail strategy:

bedroom
	|
	|
livingRoom
	|
	|
kitchen ------ pantry ------ castle
	|
	|
backyard
	|
	|
treasureRoom
 
and the three weapons : broadsword, submachine gun and the bomb is placed in bedroom, backyard and pantry repectively, note that somtimes you cannot pick up the weapon you want as you are carrying too much things.
You'll be in the living room at the start of the game.

I did not change modules in the project.

So hero, go to pick up a weapon and kill the dragon , then take treasure and go to find your princess in the castle!

Thank you.
